Steps to execute web application in two ways :

4. Result messages displayed in Reporter.output in index.html.

MOBILE
All I could do is setup the structure for running test. Could complete if I could get more time because this is my first attempt in mobile automation. Have tested mobile apps manually before.
Done so far :
After running StraitsTest.java as TestNG test, apk gets installed on the connected device.
